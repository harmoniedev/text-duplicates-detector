    "a" : "Rick Sanchez\r\nMain article: Rick Sanchez\r\nA  white man with gray spiky hair and a gray unibrow wearing a lab coat.\r\nRick Sanchez\r\nRick Sanchez (voiced by Justin Roiland[1][2]) – A genius, sociopathic, emotionally abusive, very dismissive, narcissistic, self-centered, incredibly intelligent and alcoholic mad scientist who is the father of Beth Smith and the maternal grandfather of Morty and Summer. His alcoholic tendencies lead his daughter's family to worry about the safety of their son Morty. The series is often retroscripted for Rick's lines. He displays \"diagnosable qualities of various mental illnesses\". An extremely intellectual character that views his time as valuable,[3] he disparages the usefulness of many ordinary human conventions such as school, marriage, and even love, though he displays genuine affection towards his grandchildren and daughter throughout the series. His reaction to the mundane requests asked of him by Morty and other family members suggests he considers himself wholly superior to them, though in several instances throughout the series he shows a lonelier side. He frequently 'burp-talks' words in the middle of a sentence while speaking, presumably as a result of his alcoholism. He is identified as Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension C-137. In \"The Wedding Squanchers\", Rick alongside Squanchy and Birdperson were revealed to be freedom fighters against the Galactic Federation who labeled them terrorists with warrants for their arrest. In order to guarantee the safety of his family, Rick leaves a tip on where he can be found as he surrenders to the Galactic Federation and is incarcerated in one of their prisons. In \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\" it is revealed that Rick actually turned himself in, in a scheme to destroy the Federation's economy; when the Council of Ricks interferes, Rick also takes the opportunity to take down the Council of Ricks. Rick also orchestrated \"sending\" Jerry away for his earlier attempt to convince the family to turn him into Federation custody, and making Rick \"the de-facto patriarch of the household\". However, Rick's attempt at driving Jerry away was unsuccessful, resulting in a diminished role in the family. The character was inspired primarily by Emmett Brown from Back to the Future.\r\n\r\nMorty Smith\r\n A boy in a yellow t-shirt sits on a couch clutching a TV remote.\r\nMorty Smith\r\nMorty Smith (voiced by Justin Roiland[1]) – Rick's 14-year-old grandson who is frequently dragged into Rick's misadventures. Morty is a good kid but he is easily distressed. He is often reluctant to follow Rick's plans, and he often ends up traumatized by the unorthodox and morally questionable methods Rick uses to 'fix' situations. The main Morty the episodes follow is referred to as the \"Mortiest Morty\" by Rick due to his courage, which nearly every other Morty lacks due to their main use being makeshift cloaking devices, in which \"Morty waves\" cancel out a Rick's \"genius waves\" (a concept Morty takes offense to). In \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\", Morty is angry at Rick for abandoning them and convinces Summer not to do so, and even comes close to killing Rick when it appears that he is threatening Summer's life, though in the end after Rick returns home, Morty is glad to have his grandfather back. However, in \"The Rickchurian Mortydate\", Morty refuses to be at Rick's side when he decides to leave and stays with his parents and Summer. In \"Raising Gazorpazorp\" he accidentally impregnates an alien breeding robot, which gives birth to his half-alien son, Mortimer Smith Jr. Throughout the series, several characters mention that Morty has a learning disability, and he often displays low self-esteem. Despite this, he's shown to be intelligent and resourceful at times and as the series progresses he learns how to use many of Rick's devices and even manipulates Rick into taking Jerry on an adventure. By the end of season three he displays an uncanny degree of common sense as well as a deep understanding of Rick's twisted mind, as seen in \"Vindicators 3: The Return of Worldender\". The character was inspired primarily by Marty McFly from Back to the Future.\r\n\r\nBeth Smith\r\nA white woman with shoulder length blonde hair and her arms crossed in front of her.\r\nBeth Smith\r\nBeth Smith (née Sanchez) (voiced by Sarah Chalke) – Rick's daughter, Summer and Morty's mother, and Jerry's wife. She is a veterinarian who specializes in horse surgery, a job she internally feels to be beneath her and is often defensive when her career is compared to human medicine. Level-headed and assertive, she struggles with her husband's ego, which thrives in defiance of his proven mediocrity. Several episodes have dealt with Beth's deep dissatisfaction with her life, stemming from her belief that she has \"settled\" in her marriage, family, and job. She wanted to become a \"real\" surgeon but became pregnant with Summer at 17. She is the most assertive force in her household, while also displaying traits of selfishness, humor, and intelligence. Beth is unperturbed by her father's destructive and dangerous tendencies around her son. She, from childhood, views Rick more favorably than her mother due to the parental separation.[3] Harmon expanded upon this origin in an interview: \"Kids can sometimes idolize their worst parent and blame their supportive parent for chasing off the dad with the guts to leave. ... She believes that Rick, as crazy as he is, is the better of her two parents even though she was raised by her mother and she blames her mother's unremarkability on her father's departure and will do anything to keep her father back in her life.\"[3] In \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\", Beth is heartbroken that Rick abandoned her again and is unhappy with the federation's new conditions as the medicine they provide makes horses healthier than ever, which affects her job. She is glad when Rick comes back home again, but Jerry, sick of Rick, forces her to choose between Rick and himself. Beth chooses Rick over Jerry, leading to their implied divorce. In \"The ABC's of Beth\", it is revealed that Beth shares the same sociopathic tendencies as her father. After Rick offers to make Beth a clone of herself to tend to her family while she can explore the multiverse, she begins to believe that she herself is the clone and goes to Jerry for help. Beth realizes that she loves Jerry, and calls off the divorce, renewing her bond with her family and no longer insecure about Rick abandoning her again.a",
    "b" : "abandoning her again.\r\n\r\nJerry Smith\r\n A white man with brown hair wearing a green shirt with two brown stripes.\r\nJerry Smith\r\nJerry Smith (voiced by Chris Parnell[1]) – Summer and Morty's insecure father, Beth's husband, and Rick's son-in-law, who strongly disapproves of Rick's influence over his family. Jerry used to work at a low-level advertising agency until he was fired for incompetence. Generally insecure, he is frequently led into conflicts stemming from opportunistic posturing, while his marriage is sometimes jeopardized by his wife's reactions to his poor relationship with Rick. Beth views Jerry as meek under his boasts, ultimately fearful of confrontation. However, it is strongly suggested that in spite of their problems, they are emotionally co-dependent. The episode \"Mortynight Run\" reveals that one of the Ricks, keenly aware that every Jerry is incapable of surviving off of Earth, created a daycare where every Jerry is dropped off by their Rick and Morty during adventures should they attempt to accompany them. It is revealed in the same episode that in some dimensions, Beth has left Jerry and remarried. By the end of \"The Wedding Squanchers\", having attempted to talk his family into selling Rick out, Jerry becomes the only member of the family to benefit from the Earth joining the Galactic Federation. After the federation collapses, Jerry puts his foot down and tells Beth it is him or Rick, but Beth chooses her father and tells Rick she and Jerry are getting a divorce. Rick later claims to Morty in a rant that he planned this because Jerry had planned to betray him. As Jerry leaves, Summer ignores him and Rick waits for him to leave. Summer comes to terms with the separation and reconciles with him. In \"The Rickchurian Mortydate\", Jerry and Beth reconnect and she calls off the divorce.\r\n\r\nSummer Smith\r\n A teenage girl with strawberry-blonde hair pulled back in a ponytail. She has her arms crossed in front of her and is wearing a pink tanktop.\r\nSummer Smith\r\nSummer Smith (voiced by Spencer Grammer[1]) – Morty's 17-year-old older sister, a more conventional and often superficial teenager, who is obsessed with improving her status among her peers. Summer is generally similar to her mother, as she is often shown to be very smart and humorous, but she has also shown elements of Jerry's approval-seeking. She occasionally expresses jealousy that Morty gets to accompany Rick on his inter-dimensional adventures. In the second season, she accompanies Rick and Morty on adventures more frequently and sometimes will even prove herself to be more competent than Morty, especially when emotional nuance is required. Summer has, on occasion, been shown to think similar to Rick, such as quickly figuring out a way to save herself and Rick from execution, and correctly deducing that dead flies in Rick's garage were more than they appeared. Summer cares about Rick, and sees him as a hero. In \"The Rickshank Rickdemption\", she is the only member of the family who wants to rescue Rick despite the pleas of her brother that Rick is nothing more than a selfish jerk. When their parents agreed on a divorce, Summer began resenting her father and started showing her dark side, until she reconciles with him.\r\nRick Sanchez\r\nMain article: Rick Sanchez\r\nA  white man with gray spiky hair and a gray unibrow wearing a lab coat.\r\nRick Sanchez\r\nRick Sanchez (voiced by Justin Roiland[1][2]) – A genius, sociopathic, emotionally abusive, very dismissive",
